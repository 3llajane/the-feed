 I use the internet mostly for entertainment purposes and to stay connected with people. Entertainment for me means watching content that others create. I like to connect with others in many ways: posting highlights of what I am doing to my social media accounts, texting my friends, using pinterest, buying from idependent designers etc.

 In the first glance back photo I was at work and realized that I had not done any homework in three days, in the third photo I was waiting to get on a zoom call with my Mom! In the fifth picture I was scrolling on Instagram during class, and in the eighth picture I was waiting to log into a zoom meeting for a job that I turned down.
